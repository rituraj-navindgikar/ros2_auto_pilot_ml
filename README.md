In progress

A machine learning-powered navigation system that enables a robot to make autonomous movement decisions using LiDAR data. This project demonstrates how /scan (LiDAR) data is processed and combined with /cmd_vel (velocity commands) to train a machine learning model, which is then used for real-time navigation.
